## Transformer in Triton (wip)

Implementation of a Transformer, but completely in <a href="https://triton-lang.org/">Triton</a>. I'm completely new to lower-level neural net code, so this repository will mostly be a learning experience, with the end-goal being a vanilla transformer that is faster and more efficient to train.

- [x] softmax
- [x] cross-entropy (using triton ops)
- [x] layernorm forward
- [x] layernorm backwards
- [x] batch matrix multiply + fused act forwards
- [ ] batch matrix multiply + fused act backwards
- [ ] fused attention (expand on softmax)
- [ ] benchmark and optimize
- [ ] kernels conditional on inference vs training

## Install

```bash
$ pip install triton-transformer
```

## Usage

```python
import torch
from triton_transformer import Transformer

model = Transformer(
    num_tokens = 256,
    max_seq_len = 1024,
    dim = 512,
    depth = 6,
    heads = 8,
    dim_head = 64
)

x = torch.randint(0, 256, (1, 1024))
mask = torch.ones(1, 1024).bool()

logits = model(x, mask = mask) # (1, 1024, 256)
```

## Test - GPT training

```bash
$ python train.py
```
